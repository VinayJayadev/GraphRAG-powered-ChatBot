Telemedicine is the remote delivery of healthcare services using telecommunications technology. It allows patients to consult with healthcare providers through video calls, phone calls, or messaging platforms without being physically present in a medical facility. Telemedicine has become increasingly important during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling safe access to healthcare while reducing the risk of virus transmission. It includes services such as virtual consultations, remote monitoring, digital prescriptions, and online health education. Telemedicine improves access to healthcare for patients in rural areas, reduces travel time and costs, and enables more efficient use of healthcare resources. However, it also presents challenges including technology barriers, privacy concerns, and limitations in physical examinations. The field is supported by regulations that govern telemedicine practice, reimbursement policies, and quality standards. Future developments include AI-powered diagnostics, wearable health monitoring devices, and integrated telemedicine platforms that connect patients with multiple healthcare providers.
