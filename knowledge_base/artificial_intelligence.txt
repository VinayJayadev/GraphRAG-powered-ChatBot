Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. The field encompasses various approaches including machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, and expert systems. AI applications are found in healthcare, finance, transportation, entertainment, and many other industries. Recent advances in large language models and generative AI have revolutionized how we interact with technology, enabling more natural human-computer interactions and automated content creation.
