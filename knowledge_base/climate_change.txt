Climate Change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate variations occur naturally, human activities since the 1800s have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels which generates greenhouse gas emissions. The main greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Climate change is causing rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Mitigation strategies include transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and carbon capture technologies. Adaptation measures involve building resilient infrastructure and developing drought-resistant crops. Climate change affects ecosystems, agriculture, water resources, and human health. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation, policy changes, and technological innovation to reduce emissions and adapt to changing conditions.
