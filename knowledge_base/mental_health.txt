Mental Health refers to emotional, psychological, and social well-being that affects how people think, feel, and act. It influences how individuals handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health conditions include depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global mental health, leading to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and stress-related conditions. Mental health awareness has grown, reducing stigma and encouraging people to seek help. Treatment approaches include psychotherapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and support groups. Digital mental health tools, including mobile apps, online therapy platforms, and AI-powered chatbots, are expanding access to mental health services. Workplace mental health programs and employee assistance programs are becoming more common. Mental health parity laws ensure that mental health services are covered by insurance to the same extent as physical health services. Prevention and early intervention are key to improving mental health outcomes and reducing the burden of mental illness on individuals and society.
