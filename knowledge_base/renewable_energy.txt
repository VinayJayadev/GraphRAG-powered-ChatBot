Renewable Energy refers to energy sources that are naturally replenished and virtually inexhaustible on human timescales. The main types include solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass energy. Solar energy harnesses sunlight using photovoltaic cells or solar thermal systems. Wind energy converts wind motion into electricity using wind turbines. Hydroelectric power generates electricity from flowing water. Geothermal energy utilizes heat from the Earth's core. Biomass energy comes from organic materials like wood, agricultural waste, and algae. Renewable energy is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. The costs of renewable energy technologies have decreased significantly, making them competitive with fossil fuels. Many countries are investing heavily in renewable energy infrastructure to achieve carbon neutrality and energy independence. The transition to renewable energy is creating new jobs and economic opportunities while addressing environmental challenges.
