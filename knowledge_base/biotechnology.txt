Biotechnology is the application of biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use. It combines biology with technology to develop products and technologies that improve human life and health. Key areas include genetic engineering, pharmaceutical development, agricultural biotechnology, and environmental biotechnology. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has revolutionized the field by enabling precise modifications to DNA. Biotechnology has led to the development of life-saving drugs, genetically modified crops, biofuels, and environmental cleanup solutions. The field is rapidly advancing with innovations in synthetic biology, personalized medicine, and regenerative medicine. Biotechnology companies are working on treatments for cancer, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases, promising to transform healthcare and agriculture in the coming decades.
