Healthcare Technology encompasses the use of technology to improve healthcare delivery, patient outcomes, and healthcare system efficiency. It includes electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine platforms, medical devices, health information systems, and artificial intelligence applications in healthcare. Digital health technologies include mobile health apps, wearable devices, remote monitoring systems, and virtual reality applications for therapy and training. Healthcare technology improves patient care by enabling better communication between providers, reducing medical errors, and facilitating evidence-based decision making. Electronic health records centralize patient information and improve care coordination. Medical imaging technologies like MRI, CT scans, and ultrasound provide detailed views of internal body structures. Robotic surgery systems enable minimally invasive procedures with greater precision. Healthcare technology also includes cybersecurity measures to protect patient data and ensure privacy. The field is regulated by agencies like the FDA to ensure safety and effectiveness. Challenges include high implementation costs, interoperability issues, and the need for healthcare provider training. Future trends include personalized medicine, AI-powered diagnostics, and integrated healthcare ecosystems.
