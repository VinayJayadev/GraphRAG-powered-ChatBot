Space Exploration is the investigation of outer space using astronomy and space technology. It involves the discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space through the use of space technology and astronomy. Major milestones include the launch of Sputnik in 1957, the Apollo moon landings, the International Space Station, and Mars rover missions. Current space exploration efforts focus on Mars colonization, asteroid mining, and deep space missions. Private companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are revolutionizing space travel with reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. The James Webb Space Telescope has provided unprecedented views of the universe. Space exploration drives technological innovation, scientific discovery, and international cooperation. Future missions aim to establish human settlements on Mars, explore Europa's oceans, and search for extraterrestrial life. The space industry is growing rapidly with increasing commercial opportunities and government investments.
