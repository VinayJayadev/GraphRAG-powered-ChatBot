Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. This creates an immutable and transparent record of transactions. Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central bank. Bitcoin, created in 2009, was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most well-known. Other popular cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, which introduced smart contracts, and various altcoins. Blockchain technology has applications beyond cryptocurrency, including supply chain management, voting systems, identity verification, and decentralized finance (DeFi). The technology promises to increase transparency, reduce fraud, and eliminate intermediaries in various industries.
