Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience. Deep Learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and game playing. Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. The availability of large datasets and powerful computing resources has accelerated the development and deployment of deep learning models across various industries.
